## Motivation:

Human Emotion Recognition: We decided on emotion recognition, as sentiment analysis is an important subject and human emotion is a large part of that. It could have a significant positive impact on society, from improving mental health care to enhancing user experiences in various applications. There is also a great deal to be learned here, with this project crossing through multiple disciplines such as psychology, HCI, and of course computer vision. There is also a lot of work to be done in this field further than human emotion recognition, such as tying emotions to colors. This project is a great opportunity to dip our toes into this subject.

## Milestones:

- Gather a dataset
- Face recognition Training
- Emotion recognition Training
- Create classification for emotions
- Emotion classification accuracy
- Object detection for multiple subjects

## Evaluation:

We will connect to a camera or upload pictures of peopleâ€™s faces and check what emotion they are showing. A success would be a recognition of the face regardless of the emotion shown or given. Later on as the milestones progress, the success would be giving the correct emotion.
